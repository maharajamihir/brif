<h1 id="pride-and-prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</h1>
<p>A single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a
wife. This truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding
families, that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or
other of their daughters. “I am thinking of his marrying one of them,”
replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome?” Mr. Bennet was so odd a
mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the
experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his
wife understand his character. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. The business of her life was
to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.</p>
