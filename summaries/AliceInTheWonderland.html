<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>Alice fell down a rabbit-hole after a White Rabbit with pink eyes.
The Rabbit had taken a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket. Alice had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it. Alice was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Did
you ever eat a bat?” when she fell. She found herself in a long, low
hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There
were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice
had been all the way down one side and up A little girl eats a cake with
the words “EAT ME” written on it. The cake makes her grow larger, and
she is able to reach the door to the garden. But when she gets to the
door, she finds she has forgotten the key. She tries to climb up one of
the legs of the table, but it is too slippery.</p>

<p>‘You may not have lived much under the sea,’ said Alice, ‘and perhaps
you were never even introduced to a lobster–’ (Alice began to say ‘I
once tasted–’ but checked herself hastily, and said ‘No, never’) ‘–so
you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!’
The two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this
time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at ‘I do so like
that curious song about the whiting!’ said the Mock Turtle. ‘Do you know
why it’s called a whiting?’ said the Gryphon. ‘It Does The Boots And
Shoes.’ the GryPHon replied very solemnly. ‘They’re done with blacking,
I believe.’ ‘Boots and shoes under the sea,’ the Gry Aphon went on in a
deep voice, ‘are done with a white’ ‘I might as well be at school at
once,’ thought Alice. ‘I should like to have it explained,’ said the
Mock Turtle. ‘How COULD he turn them out with his nose, you know?’ Alice
said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to
change the subject. ‘Shall we try another figure of the Lobster
Quadrille?’ the Gryphon went on. ‘Or would you like the Mock turtle to
sing you ’What trial is it?’ Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon
only answered ‘Come on!’ and ran the faster. More and more faintly came,
carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words: ‘Soo–oop
of the e–e–evening’</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the
name of nearly everything there. The King and Queen of Hearts were
seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled
about them–all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole
pack of cards. The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter, ‘or I’ll have you
executed on the spot’ Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was. She was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court. But on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her. ‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought
Alice. ‘I’ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials,
“There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed
by the officers of the court,” and I never understood what it meant till
now’</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the King in a very grave voice,
‘until all the jurymen are back in their proper places– All’ All except
the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its
mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court. ‘Consider your
verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. ‘There’s more
evidence to come yet, please your Majesty’ The jury all wrote down on
their slates, ‘SHE doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it,’
but none of them attempted to explain the paper. ‘I seem to see some
meaning in them, after all,’ said the King, spreading out the verses on
his knee. ‘But, it goes on “They All Returned From Him To You,”’ said
Alice. ‘Why, you don’t even know what they’re about!’ ‘Let the jury
consider their verdict,’ the King said, for about the twentieth time
that day. ‘No, no!’ said the Queen. ‘Sentence first–verdict afterwards.’
‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly. ‘You’re nothing but a pack of
cards!’</p>

<p>Alice’s Right Foot, Esq. Hearthrug, Near The Fender, (With Alice’s
Love) is a story of a young girl’s search for her identity. The story is
told in the form of a series of short stories, beginning with the Pool
of Tears. Alice, who had been nine feet high, was now shrinking rapidly.
She tried to speak to a mouse, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange.
She was soon up to her chin in salt water, and thought she had fallen
into the sea. She soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which
she had wept when she was nine feet tall. Alice asked the Mouse in
French: “Où est ma chatte?” which was the first sentence in her French
lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed
to quiver all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice
hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite
forgot you didn’t like cats.”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale are two of the most famous tales of the
world. The story is told in the form of a race between birds and
animals. It is told from the point of view of a young girl, Alice, who
wants to know how to get dry again. , here and there. There was no “One,
two, three, and away,” but they began running when they liked, and left
off when they like, so that it was not easy to know when the race was
over. When they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, “ “I wish I had our Dinah here, I
know I do!” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. “And who
is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” “She’s such a capital
one for catching mice you can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her
after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at
it!”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h2>
<p>The White Rabbit sent Alice a message, asking her to fetch him a pair
of gloves and a fan. Alice was so frightened that she ran off in the
direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had
made. She came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a
bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT” engraved upon it. She went
in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should
meet “I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole,” thought Alice.
“At least there’s no room to grow up any more here.” “How can you learn
lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all
for any lesson-books!” After a few minutes she heard a voice outside,
and stopped to listen. Alice heard a general chorus of “There goes
Bill!” then the Rabbit’s voice along. “We must burn the house down,”
said the Rabbit. Alice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to
begin with.” A shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window,
and some of them hit her in the face. A bright idea came into her head,
and she ate one of the cakes “And yet what a dear little puppy it was!”
said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself. “I should
have liked teaching it tricks very much, if I’d only been the right size
to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that I’ve got to grow up again!
Let me see—how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink
something or other; but the great question is</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h2>
<p>Caterpillar takes hookah out of its mouth and addresses Alice in a
languid, sleepy voice. “Who are you?” said the Caterpillar. Alice
replied, rather shyly, “I hardly know, sir, just at present” “You are
old,” said the youth, “one would hardly suppose That your eye was as
steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose— What
made you so awfully clever?” “I have answered three questions, and that
is enough,’ Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs! Do you think I
can listen all day to such stuff? Be off, or I’ll kick you down Alice, a
little girl, was wandering through a wood when a pigeon flew into her
face and beat her with its wings. The Pigeon said it was on the look-out
for serpents night and day. “I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems to
suit them!” said Alice. ‘I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you
never tasted an egg!’ said the pigeon. It was so long since she had been
anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first. She
set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other,
and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h2>
<p>Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. A footman in livery
rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by another
footman with a round face, and large eyes like a frog. Both footmen,
Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads. Alice
laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fear
of their hearing her. Duchess and cook were arguing over a cat in the
kitchen. The cook was throwing pots and pans at the baby and the
Duchess. The baby was sneezing and howling alternately without a
moment’s pause. The Duchess said: “If everybody minded their own
business, the world would go round a deal faster.” Alice caught a baby
pig and nursed it. She carried it out into the open air. She saw a
Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. She asked the
Cat: “Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”
“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have come here.” “I call
it purring, not growling,’ said Alice. “Do you play croquet with the
Queen to-day?” asked the Cat. ‘I should like it very much,‘ said Alice,
‘but I haven’t been invited yet.’ “You’ll see me there,“</p>

<p>The March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at a table set out
under a tree in front of the house. A Dormouse was sitting between them,
fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their
elbows on it, and talking over its head. ‘There’s Plenty of room!’ said
Alice indignantly. ‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an
encouraging tone. Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in
it, and yet it was certainly English. ‘I don’t quite understand you,’
she said, as politely as she could. Hatter: ‘We quarrelled last
March–just before He went mad, you know–’ (pointing with his tea spoon
at the March Hare,) ‘–it was at the great concert given by the Queen of
Hearts, and I had to sing”Twinkle, twinkle ’Once upon a time there were
three little sisters,’ the Dormouse began in a great hurry; ‘and their
names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a
well’ ‘What did they live on?’ said Alice, who always took a great
interest in questions of eating and drinking. ‘They lived on treacle,’
said the D Cormouse, after thinking a minute or two. Alice tried to
fancy to herself what such ‘Really, now you ask me,’ said Alice, very
much confused, ‘I don’t think–’ ‘Then you shouldn’t talk,’ said the
Hatter. ‘I’ll never go There again!’ said Alice as she picked her way
through the wood. ‘It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my
life!’</p>
<h2 id="chapter-11">Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Alice was watching three gardeners painting red roses on a rose-tree.
She heard one of them say, ‘Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint
over me like that!’ The Queen called out ‘The Queen! The Queen!’ and the
gardeners threw themselves flat upon their faces. The Queen turned with
fury and screamed like a wild beast. Alice was walking by the White
Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. He looked anxiously
over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put
his mouth close to her ear, and whispered ‘She’s under sentence of
execution’ ‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. ‘The
Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the Queen said–’
‘They’re dreadfully fond of beheading people here,’ thought Alice, ‘the
great wonder is, that there’s any one left alive!’ She was looking about
for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without
being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air. ‘It’s the
Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to’ The Queen’s argument
was that you couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it
off from. The King’s was that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense. And the Queen’s was,
that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time she’d have
everybody executed, all round.</p>

<p>The Mock Turtle’s Story begins with an encounter with a Duchess. The
story goes on from there, following the adventures of Alice and the
Duchess. At the end of the story, the story is told in the form of a
short novel. It is the story of a young girl who meets a flamingo. ‘A
fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. ‘Now, I
give you fair warning,’ shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she
spoke; ‘either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no
time! Take your choice!’ ‘Once,’ said the Mock Turtle at last, with a
deep sigh, ‘I was a real Turtle’ These words were followed by a very
long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of ‘Hjckrrh!’
from the Gryphon. The Mock Turtle went on: ‘We had the best of
educations–in fact, we went to school every day–’ ‘So he did, so he
did,’ said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn. ‘He taught Laughing and
Grief, they used to say’ ‘And how many hours a day did you do lessons?’
said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. ‘Ten hours the first day’
said the Mock Turtle. ‘Nine the next, and so on’</p>
