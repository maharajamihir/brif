<h1 id="the-intelligent-investor">The Intelligent Investor</h1>
<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<p>The purpose of this book is to introduce the reader to the concept of
the intelligent investor. The phrase “reckless investors” was once used
by the Wall Street Journal to describe those who were reckless with
their money. The defensive investor is one who is interested in safety
and freedom from bother. The distinction between investment and
speculation in common stocks has always been a useful one and its
disappearance is a cause for concern. We must prevent our readers from
accepting the common jargon which applies the term “investor” to anybody
and everybody in the stock market. We trust that the reader of this book
will gain a reasonably clear idea of the risks that are inherent in
common-stock commitments. In 1965 the investor could obtain about 4½% on
high-grade taxable bonds and 3¼% on good tax-free bonds. The dividend
return on leading common stocks (with the DJIA at 892) was only about
3.2%. This fact, and others, suggested caution. Few people were willing
to consider the possibility that the high rate of advance in stock
prices are too high. The major change since 1964 has been the rise in
interest rates on first-grade bonds to record high levels. The
obtainable return on good corporate issues is now about 7½% and even
more against 4½% in 1964. The dividend return on DJIA-type stocks had a
fair advance also during the market decline of 1969–70. The interest and
principal payments on good bonds are much better protected and therefore
more certain than the dividends and price appreciation on stocks. We
cannot be certain that bonds will work out better than stocks from
today’s levels. There is the possibility—though we consider it remote—of
an accelerating inflation, which in one way or another would have to
make stock equities preferable to bonds. The defensive investor must
confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record
of profitable operations and in strong financial condition. Aggressive
investors may buy other types of common stocks, but they should be on a
definitely attractive basis as established by intelligent analysis. The
third is the device of “dollar-cost averaging,” which means simply that
the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars
each month or each quarter. The author says it is possible for an
investor to benefit greatly by making correct predictions when Wall
Street as a whole is making incorrect ones. But that is only
theoretical. How many enterprising investors could count on having the
acumen or prophetic gift to beat the professional analysts at their
favorite game, he asks. Investing is a unique kind of casino—one where
you cannot lose in the end. Graham urges you to invest only if you would
be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its
daily share price. By speculating instead of investing, you lower your
own odds of building wealth and raise someone else’s. In the 1990s,
America became the Speculation Nation, populated with traders who went
shooting from stock to stock like grasshoppers whizzing around in an
August hay field. To reach your long-term financial goals, you must be
sustainably and reliably right. In short streaks, so long as your luck
holds out, they will get you killed. By 1999 at least six million people
were trading online. Barbra Streisand: “I’m Taurus the bull, so I react
to red. If I see red, I sell my stocks quickly” Juno Online Services
unveiled a trailblazing business plan: to lose as much money as
possible. The “January effect’ was widely promoted in scholarly articles
and popular books in the 1980s. Many investors sell their crummiest
stocks late in the year to lock in losses that can cut their tax bills.
Professional money managers grow more cautious as the year draws to a
close. The Foolish Four was one of the most cockamamie stock-picking
formulas ever concocted. In 2000 alone, the four Foolish stocks lost 14%
while the Dow dropped by just 4.7%. Each of these so-called investing
approaches fell prey to Graham’s Law. Never put more than 10% of your
assets into your mad money account. Never mingle the money in your
account with what’s in your investment accounts. Never allow your
thinking to spill over into your investing activities. Don’t confuse
investment with investment.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<p>Inflation, and the fight against it, has been very much in the
public’s mind in recent years. The shrinkage in the purchasing power of
the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hope by
speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, has greatly
influenced the thinking of Wall Street. Common stocks have indeed done
better than bonds over a long period of time in the past. There is no
close time connection between inflationary (or deflationary) conditions
and the movement of common-stock earnings and prices. Both stock
earnings and stock prices as a whole have declined since 1965. The
investor cannot count on much above the recent five-year rate earned. In
the economic cycles of the past, good business was accompanied by a
rising price level and poor business by falling prices. It was generally
felt that “a little inflation’ was helpful to business profits. But the
figures in Table 2-2 indicate that so far from inflation having
benefited our corporations and their shareholders, its effect has been
the opposite. Inflation in the U.S. has probably run around 1% annually
for the past 20 years. Money Illusion: What psychologists call the
“money illusion.” If you receive a 2% raise when inflation runs at 4%,
you will almost certainly feel better than when it runs at 2% in a year.
As recently as 1973–1982, the U.S. went through one of the most painful
bursts of inflation in our history. 69% of the world’s market-oriented
countries have suffered at least one year in which inflation ran at an
annualized rate of 25% or more. On average, those inflationary periods
destroyed 53% of an investor’s purchasing power. Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities are U.S. government bonds that
automatically go up in value when inflation rises. When the value of
your TIPS bond rises as inflation heats up, the Internal Revenue Service
regards that increase in value as taxable income. Because of this
exasperating tax complication, TIPS are best suited for a tax-deferred
retirement account.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<p>This chapter looks at the level of stock prices at the beginning of
1972. The long-term history of the stock market is summarized in two
tables and a chart. Table 3-1 sets forth the low and high points of
nineteen bear- and bull-market cycles. The reader will note three quite
distinct patterns, each covering about a third of the 70 years. The
annual rate of price advance between 1949 and 1970 works out at about 9%
for the S &amp; P composite (or the industrial index) The year 1970 was
marked by a definite deterioration in the overall earnings posture of
our corporations. The rate of profit on invested capital fell to the
lowest percentage since the World War years. A considerable number of
companies reported net losses for the year; many became “financially
troubled” When we approached this problem in 1953 the average market
level for that year had reached 275, a gain of over 50% in five years.
We were concerned about the fact that in 1953, the averages had advanced
for a longer period than in most bull markets of the past. Setting these
factors against our favorable value judgment, we advised a cautious or
compromise policy. Investors should not conclude that the 1964 market
level is dangerous merely because they read it in this book. The
principles of investment, as set forth herein, would call for the
following policy under 1964 conditions: No borrowing to buy or hold
securities. A reduction in common-stock holdings where needed to bring
it down to a maximum of 50 per cent of the total portfolio. In this
chapter, Graham shows how prophetic he can be. He looks two years ahead,
foreseeing the “catastrophic” bear market of 1973–1974. He also looks
more than two decades into the future, eviscerating the logic of market
gurus and best-selling books. The stock market crushed everyone who had
come to believe that the high returns of the late 1990s were some kind
of divine right. There was a fatal flaw in the argument that stocks have
“always” beaten bonds in the long run: Reliable figures before 1871 do
not exist. From 1995 through 1999, as the market rose by at least 20%
each year, stock buyers became ever more optimistic. On March 24, 2000,
the total value of the U.S. stock market peaked at $14.75 trillion. By
October 9, 2002, just 30 months later, it was worth $7.34 trillion.
Robert Shiller compares the current price of the Standard &amp; Poor’s
500-stock index against average corporate profits over the past 10
years. When his ratio goes well above 20, the market usually delivers
poor returns afterward. When it drops well below 10, stocks typically
produce handsome gains down the road.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4</h2>
<p>We have suggested as a fundamental guiding rule that the investor
should never have less than 25% or more than 75% of his funds in common
stocks. The maximum return would be realized by the alert and
enterprising investor who exercises maximum intelligence and skill. The
percentage of the portfolio held in equities by the two major types of
funds—“balanced” and “common-stock”—has changed very little from year to
year. Yale University followed a somewhat similar plan for a number of
years after 1937. Yale seems to have given up its once famous formula,
and in 1969 held 61% of its portfolio in equities. The much larger
income return now offered by good bonds than by representative stocks is
a potent argument for favoring the bond component. U.S. savings bonds
still possess certain unique merits that make them a suitable purchase
by any individual investor. Bonds lost, destroyed, or stolen may be
replaced without cost. There are limitations on annual purchases, but
liberal provisions for co-ownership by family members make it possible
for most investors to buy as many as they can afford. The average
investor has several choices among high-grade bonds. Those in high
income-tax brackets can undoubtedly obtain a better net yield from good
tax-free issues than from taxable ones. The yield on these bonds will
vary both with the quality and the maturity, with the shorter maturities
giving the lower return. Tax-exempt “New Housing” issues, and the other
by the recently created (taxable) ‘New Community debentures’ yield
considerably more than ordinary United States bonds. An offering of New
Housing issues in July 1971 yielded as high as 5.8%, free from both
Federal and state taxes. Both obligations have the “full faith and
credit” of the United States government behind them. The bond form and
the preferred-stock form, as hitherto discussed, are well-understood and
relatively simple matters. The best-known types are convertible and
similar issues, and income bonds. In the latter type, interest does not
have to be paid unless it is earned by the company. In strict logic, all
investment-grade preferred stocks should be bought by corporations. The
most striking thing about Graham’s discussion of how to allocate your
assets between stocks and bonds is that he never mentions the word
“age.” That sets his advice firmly against the winds of conventional
wisdom. An 89-year-old with $3 million, an ample pension, and a gaggle
of grandchildren would be foolish to move most of her money into bonds.
Graham advises you never to have more than 75% of your total assets in
stocks. For a tiny minority of investors, a 100%-stock portfolio may
make sense. If not, steer mostly clear of stocks, edging toward Graham’s
maximum of 75% in bonds or cash. Bond funds offer cheap and easy
diversification, plus monthly income. Major firms like Vanguard,
Fidelity, Schwab, and T. Rowe Price offer a broad menu of bond funds.
For investors who can confidently leave some cash untouched for years to
come, inflation-protected “I-bonds” recently offered an attractive yield
of around 4%. In most cases, the high expenses of owning an annuity will
overwhelm its advantages. Preferred shares are less secure than bonds,
since they have only a secondary claim on a company’s assets if it goes
bankrupt. No intelligent investor would ever buy a stock for its
dividend income alone.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5</h2>
<p>Common stocks were generally viewed as highly speculative and
therefore unsafe. Since 1957 common stocks have once again, through
their high prices, lost their traditional advantage in dividend yield
over bond interest rates. The defensive investor cannot afford to be
without an appreciable proportion of common stocks in his portfolio,
even if he must regard them as the lesser of two evils. Growth stocks as
a whole are too uncertain and risky a vehicle for the defensive
investor. The group of large companies that are relatively unpopular
offers a sound if unspectacular area of choice by the general public.
The New York Stock Exchange has put considerable effort into
popularizing its “monthly purchase plan’ In the last. chapter we
referred briefly to the position of the individual portfolio owner. Let
us return to this matter, in the light of our subsequent discussion of
general policy. To what extent should the type of securities selected by
the investor vary with his circumstances? We shall take: (1) a widow
left $200,000 with which to support herself and her children; (2) a
successful doctor in mid-career, with savings of $100,000 and yearly acc
The words “risk” and “safety” are applied to securities in two different
senses, with a resultant confusion in thought. A bond is clearly proved
unsafe when it defaults its interest or principal payments. It is also
true that an investment contains a risk if there is a fair possibility
that the holder may have to sell at a time when the price is below cost.
How defensive you should be depends less on your tolerance for risk than
on your willingness to put time and energy into your portfolio. If you
go about it the right way, investing in stocks is just as easy as
parking your money in bonds and cash. When stocks are priced reasonably
enough to give you future growth, then you should own them. Investing in
what you know can be so dangerous. The more familiar a stock is, the
more likely it is to turn a defensive investor into a lazy one who
thinks there’s no need to do any homework. Never before in financial
history has owning stocks been so cheap and easy. Microinvesting sites
are the only game in town for building a diversified portfolio. A
defensive investor can also own stocks through a discount broker, a
financial planner, or a full-service stockbroker. Mutual funds are the
ultimate way for a defensive investor to capture the upside of stock
ownership without having to police your own portfolio. The ideal way to
dollar-cost average is into a portfolio of index funds. That way, you
renounce not only the guessing game of where the market is going but
which sectors of the market will do the best. By putting your portfolio
on permanent autopilot, you prevent yourself from either flinging money
at the market just when it is most alluring.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6</h2>
<p>The most useful generalizations for the enterprising investor are of
a negative sort. Let him leave high-grade preferred stocks to corporate
buyers. Avoid inferior types of bonds and preferred stocks unless they
can be bought at bargain levels. The main difference between first- and
second- grade bonds is usually found in the number of times the interest
charges have been covered by earnings. Second-grade bonds and preferred
stocks possess two contradictory attributes which the intelligent
investor must bear clearly in mind. Nearly all suffer severe sinking
spells in bad markets. A second-grade 5.5 or 6% bond selling at par is
almost always a bad purchase. The same issue at 70 might make more
sense. New issues have special salesmanship behind them, which calls
therefore for a special degree of sales resistance. Most new issues are
sold under “favorable market conditions”—which means favorable for the
seller and consequently less favorable to the buyer. A tremendous amount
of financing, consisting of the repayment of existing bonds at call
price and their replacement by new issues with lower coupons, was done
in the past. In the early part of the century a large proportion of our
leading companies were introduced to public trading. As time went on,
the number of enterprises of first rank that remained closely held
steadily diminished. Many of these issues fall, proportionately, as much
below their true value as they formerly sold above it. It is doubtful
whether we ever had so many new issues offered before. In 1965 edition
of The Fool’s Guide to Investing, James Graham lists his “don’ts” for
aggressive investors. Today, more than 130 mutual funds specialize in
junk bonds. A junk-bond fund, though, is only a minor option—not an
obligation—for the intelligent investor. WorldCom’s bonds defaulted when
the company could no longer cover their interest charges.
Emerging-markets bond funds seldom move in synch with the U.S. stock
market. They are one of the rare investments that are unlikely to drop
merely because the Dow is down. Researchers divided thousands of traders
into five tiers based on how often they turned over their holdings.
Those who traded the least (at the left) kept most of their gains. But
the impatient and hyperactive traders made their brokers rich, not
themselves. Most of the high returns on IPOs are captured by members of
an exclusive private club. , 1999, the stock was placed at an initial
public offering price of $30. But demand for the shares was so ferocious
that when NASDAQ opened that morning, none of the initial owners of VA
Linux would let go of any shares until the price hit $299. The stock
peaked at $320 and closed at $239.25, a gain of 697.5% in a single day.
At the peak price on day one, investors were valuing VA Linux’</p>
<h2 id="chapter-7">Chapter 7</h2>
<p>The 50–50 plan, which we proposed to the defensive investor and
described on p. 90, is about the best specific or automatic formula we
can recommend to all investors under the conditions of 1972. Buying
carefully chosen “growth stocks” Buying bargain issues of various
typesBuying into “special situations”General Market Policy—Formula
Timing. Growth stocks have a tendency toward wide swings in market
price. Big fortunes from single-company investments are almost always
realized by persons who have a close relationship with the particular
company. The key requirement here is that the enterprising investor
concentrate on larger companies that are going through a period of
unpopularity. Large companies have a double advantage over the others.
First, they have the resources in capital and brain power to carry them
through adversity and back to a satisfactory earnings base. Second, the
market is likely to respond with reasonable speed to any improvement
shown. We define a bargain as one which, on the basis of facts, appears
to be worth considerably more than it is selling for. At low points in
the general market a large proportion of common stocks are bargain
issues, as measured by these standards. The market is fond of making
mountains out of molehills and exaggerating ordinary vicissitudes into
major setbacks. Even a mere lack of interest or enthusiasm may impel a
price decline to absurdly low levels. A common stock that sells for less
than the company’s net working capital alone, after deducting all prior
obligations, would mean that the buyer would pay nothing for the fixed
assets. A compilation made in 1957 disclosed about 150 of such common
stocks. The gain for the entire “portfolio” in that period was 75%,
against 50% for Standard &amp; Poor’s 425 industrials. World War II
period and the postwar boom were more beneficial to the smaller concerns
than to the larger ones. By 1946 the market’s pattern had completely
reversed itself from that before the war. The very class of secondary
issues that had formerly supplied by far the largest proportion of
bargain opportunities was now presenting the greatest number of examples
of overenthusiasm and overvaluation. The typical “special situation” has
grown out of the increasing number of acquisitions of smaller firms by
large ones. It often appears good business for such an enterprise to
acquire an existing company in the field it wishes to enter rather than
to start a new venture from scratch. Such corporate moves have been
producing interesting profit-making opportunities for those who have
made a study of this field. We have advised against the purchase at
“full prices” of three important categories of securities. These include
foreign bonds, ordinary preferred stocks, and secondary common stocks.
The greater number of defensive investors are to avoid these categories
regardless of price. The enterprising investor is to buy them only when
obtainable at bargain prices. These prohibitions were listed in our
first chapter on p. 30. In an ideal world, the intelligent investor
would hold stocks only when they are cheap and sell them when they
become overpriced. If you had gotten out of stocks right before the five
worst days of each year, your original $1 would have grown to $987.12.
In the financial markets, hindsight is forever 20/20, but foresight is
legally blind. Eight of the largest 150 companies on the Fortune 500
list managed to raise their earnings by at least 15% for two decades.
For the biggest 20% of companies, earnings grew by an annual average of
just 9.3%. The intelligent investor gets interested in big growth stocks
when they are at their most popular. In 1982, the average net worth of a
Forbes 400 member was $230 million. Only 64 of the original members were
still on the list in 2002. Most of these stocks lately have been in
bombed-out areas like high-tech and telecommunications. You can still
lose money on a stock like Comverse—which is why you should buy them
only if you can find a couple dozen at a time and hold them patiently.
The lesson? It’s not that you should never invest in foreign markets
like Japan. The Japanese should never have kept all their money at home.
And neither should you. Putting up to a third of your stock money in
mutual funds that hold foreign stocks helps insure against the risk that
our own backyard may not always be the best place to invest.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-8">Chapter 8</h2>
<p>The investor should know about these possibilities and should be
prepared for them both financially and psychologically. He will want to
benefit from changes in market levels. But it involves the very real
danger that it will lead him into speculative attitudes and activities.
If you want to speculate do so with your eyes open, knowing that you
will probably lose money in the end. Dow Theory for timing purchases and
sales has had an unusual history. From 1938 on the Dow theory operated
mainly by taking its practitioners out at a pretty good price but then
putting them back in again at a higher price. For nearly 30 years
thereafter, one would have done appreciably better by just buying and
holding the DJIA. Investor should have been able to identify the
recurrent bear and bull markets, to buy in the former and sell in the
latter, and to do so for the most part at reasonably short intervals of
time. The market’s behavior in the past 20 years has not followed the
former pattern, nor obeyed what once were well-established danger
signals. A substantial rise in the market is at once a legitimate reason
for satisfaction and a cause for prudent concern. But it may also bring
a strong temptation toward imprudent action. A serious investor is not
likely to believe that the day-to-day fluctuations of the stock market
make him richer or poorer. In paying market premiums the investor gives
precious hostages to fortune, for he must depend on the market itself.
Price of IBM shares fell from 607 to 300 in seven months in 1962–63;
after two splits its price fell from 387 to 219 in 1970. These striking
losses did not indicate any doubt about the future long-term growth of
IBM or Xerox; they reflected instead a lack of confidence in the premium
valuation that the stock market itself had placed on these excellent
prospects. A. &amp; P. shares rose with the general market until in 1961
the split-up stock (10 for 1) reached a high of 70½ which was equivalent
to 705 for the 1938 shares. The year after the 70½ high the price fell
by more than half to 34. In the meantime the company was to turn from an
outstanding to a mediocre earnings performer. A. &amp; P. shareholder in
1938 suffered no loss in their price decline, beyond what his own
judgment may have told him was occasioned by a shrinkage in their
underlying or intrinsic value. If no such shrinkage had occurred, he had
a right to expect that in due course the market quotation would return
to the 1937 level. The investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should
expect their prices to fluctuate and should neither be concerned by
sizable declines nor become excited by sizable advances. The shareholder
judges whether his own investment has been successful in terms both of
dividends received and of the long-range trend of the average market
value. The same criteria should logically be applied in testing the
effectiveness of a company’s management. In mid-1970 the yields on
high-grade long-term bonds were higher than at any time in the nearly
200 years of this country’s economic history. In the old days, at least,
one could often find a useful clue to the coming end of a bull or bear
market by studying the prior action of bonds, but no similar clues were
given to a coming change in interest rates. Inktomi Corp. stock hit a
new high of $231.625 on March 17, 2000. But two and a half years later,
Inktomi’s stock closed at 25 cents—collapsing from a total market value
of $25 billion to less than $40 million. Mr. Market was no more
justified in his midnight rage than he had been in his manic euphoria.
In 1999, when Mr. Market was squealing with delight, American employees
directed an average of 8.6% of their paychecks into their 401(k)
retirement plans. The cheaper stocks got, the less eager people became
to buy them, because they were imitating Mr. market. Investing isn’t
about beating others at their game, it’s about controlling yourself at
your own game. The challenge for the intelligent investor is not to find
the stocks that will go up the most and down the least. Buy every month,
automatically, and whenever else you can spare some money. Sell only
when you need the cash. New research shows that our brains are designed
to perceive trends even where they might not exist. When stocks drop,
that financial loss fires up your amygdala. Losing money is so painful
that many people, terrified at the prospect of any further loss, sell
out near the bottom or refuse to buy more. Falling stock prices are good
news, not bad, since they enable you to buy more for less money. Selling
into a bear market can make sense if it creates a tax windfall. By
putting much of your portfolio on permanent autopilot, you can fight the
prediction addiction. I hereby declare my refusal to let a herd of
strangers make my financial decisions for me. I further make a solemn
commitment never to invest because the stock market has gone up, and
never to sell because it has gone down. I will hold each of these
investments continually through at least the following date (which must
be a minimum of 10 years after the date of this contact)</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9">Chapter 9</h2>
<p>The investment industry is a very large one. At the end of 1970 there
were 383 funds registered with the SEC, having assets totaling $54.6
billions. The buying and selling prices of the closed-end funds are not
fixed by the companies, but fluctuate in the open market as does
ordinary corporate stock. Investment-fund shares in the past ten years
have fared better than the average person who made his common-stock
purchases directly. Table 9-1 gives some calculated results for
1961–1970 of our ten largest stock funds at the end of 1970. The funds’
aggregate performance as against the S &amp; P index has improved
somewhat in the last five years compared with the preceding five.
Manhattan Fund, Inc., showed an overall gain of 38.6% in 1967, against
11% for the S &amp; P composite index. The portfolio of Manhattan Fund
at the end of 1969 was unorthodox to say the least. It is an
extraordinary fact that two of its largest investments were in companies
that filed for bankruptcy within six months thereafter. In 1969 they all
showed losses, with only one managing to do a bit better than the S
&amp; P composite index. In 1970 their comparative performance was even
worse than in 1969. All financial experience up to now indicates that
large funds, soundly managed, can produce at best only slightly better
than average results over the years. The price discount has varied among
individual companies, and the average discount for the group as a whole
has also varied from one date to another. Figures on this point for
1961–1970 are given in Table 9-3. The majority of close-end shares have
been consistently obtainable at less than their asset value. A few
closed-end funds are selling at premiums greater than the true 9% charge
on most mutual funds. Mutual funds are cheap, convenient, generally
diversified, professionally managed, and tightly regulated. Because of
their imperfections, most funds underperform the market, overcharge
their investors, create tax headaches, and suffer erratic swings in
performance. The intelligent investor must choose funds with great care
in order to avoid ending up owning a big fat mess. When a fund earns
high returns, investors notice, often pouring in hundreds of millions of
dollars in a matter of weeks. Some companies specialize in “incubating”
their funds, test-driving them privately before selling them publicly.
It often costs more to trade stocks in very large blocks than in small
ones. Once a fund becomes successful, its managers tend to become timid
and timid. Index funds have only one significant flaw: They are boring.
Hold an index fund for 20 years or more, adding new money every month,
and you are all but certain to outper-forms the vast majority of
professional and individual investors alike. A low-cost index fund like
Vanguard Total Stock Market will return just under 6.7%. The average
stock fund, with its 1.5% in operating expenses and roughly 2% in
trading costs, will be lucky to gain 3.5 High returns are temporary,
while high fees are nearly as permanent as granite. If you buy a fund
for its hot returns, you may well end up with a handful of cold ashes.
The best funds often close to new investors—permitting only their
existing shareholders to buy more. Closed-end stock funds, although
popular during the 1980s, have slowly atrophied. Avoid funds with
consistently poor past returns, especially if they have above-average
annual expenses. New breed of exchange-traded index funds can be worth
exploring as well. The performance of most funds falters simply because
the type of stocks they prefer temporarily goes out of favor. In late
1997, a survey of 750 investors found that 74% believed their
mutual-fund holdings would “consistently beat the Standard &amp; Poor’s
500 each year” Most funds fail to beat the S &amp; P 500 in the long run
and many fail to beating it in any year. If you’re not prepared to stick
with a fund through at least three lean years, you shouldn’t buy it.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-10">Chapter 10</h2>
<p>The investment of money in securities is unique among business
operations in that it is almost always based in some degree on advice
received from others. Businessmen seek professional advice on various
elements of their business, but they do not expect to be told how to
make a profit. When they rely on others to make investment profits for
them, they are expecting a kind of result for which there is no true
counterpart in ordinary business affairs. Financial services offer
information and guidance to those who are directing their own financial
affairs or are themselves advising others. Many of these services
confine themselves exclusively to forecasting market movements by
various “technical” methods. Wall Street has thrived mainly on
speculation and stock-market speculators as a class. Most stock-exchange
houses have confined themselves to executing orders given them. They are
devoid of all responsibility for either the profits or the losses of
their speculative customers. The value of the security analyst to the
investor depends largely on the investor’s own attitude. If the investor
asks the analyst the right questions, he is likely to get the right—or
at least valuable—answers. The official title of chartered financial
analyst (CFA) is now awarded to those senior practitioners who pass
required examinations and meet other tests of fitness. This relatively
new apparatus of recognition and control should serve to elevate the
standards of financial analysts. The investor should use his
intelligence not only in formulating his financial policies but also in
the associated details. The relationship between the investment banker
and the investor is basically that of the salesman to the prospective
buyer. In 1959 we stated at this point: “The bad results of this unsound
attitude show themselves recurrently in the underwriting field” The
years 1960–61 and, again, 1968–69 were marked by an unprecedented
outpouring of issues of lowest quality. Investors should be wary of all
persons, whether customers’ brokers or security salesmen, who promise
spectacular income or profits. Many investors take comfort from the
experience, judgment, and second opinion that a good financial adviser
can provide. Some investors may need an outsider to show them what rate
of return they need to earn on their investments. Financial con artists
thrive by talking you into trusting them. As Ronald Reagan used to say,
“Trust, then verify.” Financial planners must register with either the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or securities regulators in the
state where their practice is based. For more tips on due diligence, see
the sidebar below. A leading financial-planning newsletter recently
canvassed dozens of advisers to get their thoughts on how you should go
about interviewing them. In screening an adviser, your goals should be
to:determine whether he or she cares about helping clients, or just goes
through the motions.assess whether the adviser is sufficiently educated,
trained, and experienced to help you. An adviser who doesn’t ask
questions like these is not a good fit. “You hire an adviser,” explains
commentator Nick Murray, “not to manage money but to manage you.” “If
the adviser is a line of defense between you and your worst impulsive
tendencies,’ says financial-planning analyst Robert Veres.</p>

<p>Financial analysis is now a well-established and flourishing
profession, or semiprofession. The security analyst deals with the past,
the present, and the future of any given security issue. He describes
the business; he summarizes its operating results and financial
position. He sets forth its strong and weak points, its possibilities
and risks. Bond Analysis concerns itself with the safety, or quality, of
bond issues and investment-grade preferred stocks. The chief criterion
used for corporate bonds is the number of times that total interest
charges have been covered by available earnings for some years in the
past. In the case of preferred stocks, it is the times that bond
interest and preferred dividends combined have beencovered. The
financial troubles of electric and gas utilities in the 1930s were
traceable almost 100% to financial excesses and mismanagement.
Receivership of a soundly capitalized (electric) utility company or
system is almost impossible. Since Securities and Exchange Commission
control was instituted,* along with the breakup of most of the
holding-company systems, public-utility financing has been sound. It
appears to be almost impossible to distinguish in advance between those
individual forecasts which can be relied upon and those which are
subject to a large chance of error. The prevalence of wide
diversification is in itself a pragmatic repudiation of the fetish of
“selectivity,” to which Wall Street constantly pays lip service. A
record of continuous dividend payments for the last 20 years or more is
an important plus factor in the company’s quality rating. Stock of a
company with a lot of surplus cash and nothing ahead of the common is
clearly a better purchase (at the same price) than another one with the
same per share earnings but large bank loans and senior securities. In
1963, a future overall return of 7½% per annum was projected for Xerox
and IBM. If the growth rate actually realized proved substantially less
than that projected in the formula, the investor would be sure to enjoy
a handsome additional return. There is really no way of valuing a
high-growth company (with an expected rate above, say, 8% annually), in
which the analyst can make realistic assumptions. We suggest that
analysts work out first what we call the “past-performance value,” which
is based solely on the past record. This would indicate what the stock
would be worth if it is assumed that its relative past performance will
continue unchanged in the future. This process could be carried out
mechanically by applying a formula that gives individual weights to past
figures for profitability, stability, and growth, and also for current
financial condition. Watch out for corporate bulimics—firms that wolf
down big acquisitions, only to end up vomiting them back out. Lucent,
Mattel, Quaker Oats, and Tyco International are among the companies that
have had to disgorge acquisitions at sickening losses. The company is a
Johnny-One-Note, relying on one customer (or a handful) for most of its
revenues. If a company reprices (or “reissues” or “exchanges”) its stock
options for insiders, stay away. You should factor in the potential
flood of new shares from stock options whenever you estimate a company’s
future value. A manager can’t legitimately be your partner if he keeps
selling while you’re buying. Warren Buffett popularized the concept of
owner earnings, or net income plus amortization and depreciation, minus
normal capital expenditures. If owner earnings per share have grown at a
steady average of at least 6% or 7% over the past 10 years, the company
is a stable generator of cash. The burden of proof is on the company to
show that you are better off if it does not pay a dividend.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-12">Chapter 12</h2>
<p>Investor: Don’t take a single year’s earnings seriously. If you do
pay attention to short-term earnings, look out for booby traps in the
per-share figures. The quarterly figures, and especially the annual
figures, receive major attention in financial circles. We shall present
examples of a really significant dilution factor below. ALCOA’s special
charges are related to future costs and losses. It is easy to say that
they are not part of the “regular operating results’ of 1970. But if so,
where do they belong? Are they so “extraordinary and nonrecurring” as to
belong nowhere? Companies used to set up “contingency reserves” out of
the profits of good years to absorb some of the bad effects of
depression years to come. We seem now to be witnessing the opposite
phenomenon, with everyone charging off as much as possible against
forgotten 1970. The more seriously investors take the per-share earnings
figures as published, the more necessary it is for them to be on their
guard. ution offsets, or twice its then current market price. If the
transaction goes through, and if the tax laws are not changed, this loss
provided for in 1970 will permit Northwest Industries to realize about
$400 million of future profits (within five years) from its other
diversified interests without paying income tax thereon. Aluminum
Company of America’s price-and-earnings history is more unusual, even
contradictory, than that of most other large enterprises. The most
widespread bit of accounting hocus-pocus was the “pro forma’ earnings
fad. As an intelligent investor, the only thing you should do with pro
forma earnings is ignore them. In the late 1990s, Global Crossing
Ltd. had unlimited ambitions. The Bermuda-based company was building
what it called the “first integrated global fiber optic network” The
intelligent investor must always be on guard for “nonrecurring” costs
that, like the Energizer bunny, just keep going. SBC explained its rosy
new expectations by noting that “for each of the three years ended 2001,
our actual 10-year return on investments exceeded 10%.” Warren Buffett’s
Berkshire Hathaway lowered the expected rate of return on its pension
assets from 8.3% to 6.5%.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-13">Chapter 13</h2>
<p>Review of four companies found successively on the New York Stock
Exchange list. ELTRA Corp. (a merger of Electric Autolite and
Mergenthaler Linotype enterprises), Emerson Electric Co. ( a
manufacturer of electric and electronic products), Emery Air Freight (a
domestic forwarder of air freight), and Emhart Corp (originally a maker
of bottling machinery only) Emerson Electric has an enormous total
market value, dwarfing the other three companies combined. It is one of
our “good-will giants,” to be commented on later. Emery Air Freight must
be the most promising of the four companies in terms of future growth.
High valuations entail high risks. Financial analysts will find Emerson
and Emery more interesting and appealing stocks than the other two. The
two companies will meet our seven statistical requirements for inclusion
in a defensive investor’s portfolio. An experienced security analyst
would have hesitated to recommend that a holder of Emerson or Emery
exchange his shares for ELTRA or Emhart at the end of 1970. EMC
Corp. was one of the best-performing stocks of the 1990s, rising more
than 81,000%. If you had invested $10,000 in EMC’s stock at the
beginning of 1990, you would have ended 1999 with just over $8.1
million. Exodus Communications, Inc. hosts and manages websites for
corporate customers. Exodus Communications stock soared 1,005.8% in
1999, enough to turn a $10,000 investment into more than $110,000 by
December 31. Wall Street’s leading Internet-stock analysts were
predicting that the stock would rise another 25% to 125% over the coming
year. In a 2-for-1 stock split, a company doubles the number of its
shares and halves their price. Emerson Electric went on to gain 40.7% in
2000. But then the shares lost 79.4% in 2001 and another 54.3% in 2002.
Exodus filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001. As of early
2003, the last trade in Exodus’s stock was at one penny a share.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-14">Chapter 14</h2>
<p>The defensive investor who follows our suggestions will purchase only
high-grade bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks. He is
to make sure that the price at which he bought the latter is not unduly
high as judged by applicable standards. He has a choice of two
approaches, the DJIA-type portfolio and the quantitatively-tested
portfolio. The reader will have to decide this important question for
himself—after weighing the arguments on both sides. We have nonetheless
opted for the inclusion of a modest requirement of growth over the past
decade. Without it the typical company would show retrogression, at
least in terms of profit per dollar of invested capital. There is no
reason for the defensive investor to include such companies. For the
defensive investor the central appeal of the public-utility stocks at
this time should be their availability at a moderate price in relation
to book value. The position of the utilities as regulated monopolies is
assuredly more of an advantage than a disadvantage for the conservative
investor. While the rise has not been as great as in the industrial
index, the individual utilities have shown more price stability in most
periods. The bankruptcy of the Penn Central Transportation Co. in 1970
shocked the financial world. A competent student could have detected the
developing weaknesses in the company’s picture and counseled against
ownership of its securities. The current price of each prominent stock
pretty well reflects the salient factors in its financial record plus
the general opinion as to its future prospects. Bacon and Rogers: Let
him emphasize diversification more than individual selection. If one
could select the best stocks unerringly, one would only lose by
diversifying. Keep 90% of your stock money in an index fund, leaving 10%
with which to try picking your own stocks. Money Magazine identified the
30 best-performing stocks over the 30 years ending in 2002. The list
includes Southwest Airlines, Worthington Steel, Dollar General discount
stores, and snuff-tobacco maker UST Inc. Most defensive investors should
steer clear of stocks with a total market value of less than $2 billion.
Graham’s insistence on “some earnings for the common stock in each of
the past ten years” remains a valid test. 57 companies in the index have
raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. Graham
recommends limiting yourself to stocks whose current price is no more
than 15 times average earnings over the past three years. Do your
homework through the EDGAR database at www.sec. gov. Read at least five
years’ worth of reports. Websites like http://quicktake.com,

<h2 id="chapter-15">Chapter 15</h2>
<p>In this chapter, addressed to the enterprising investor, we must
consider the possibilities and the means of making individual selections
which are likely to prove more profitable than an across-the-board
average. At first blush the case for successful selection appears
self-evident. Yet there is considerable and impressive evidence to the
effect that this is very hard to do. Wall Street analysts are
handicapped by a flaw in their basic approach to the problem of stock
selection. They seek the industries with the best prospects of growth,
and the companies in these industries with best management and other
advantages. This would be the only correct procedure if the earnings of
the good companies were sure to grow at a rapid rate indefinitely in the
future. From 1939 on our operations were limited to “selfliquidating”
situations, related hedges, working-capital bargains, and a few control
operations. Each of these classes gave us consistently satisfactory
results from then on. We hesitate to prescribe our own diet for any
large number of intelligent investors. Most active-minded practitioners
would prefer to venture into wider channels. Investor can feast on an
extraordinary variety of price histories, dividend and earnings
histories, financial positions, capitalization setups, and what not.
Backward-leaning conservatism, run-of-the-mine featureless companies,
the most peculiar combinations of “principal business,” all kinds of
Wall Street gadgets and widgets—they are all there. We have tested this
performance for three 30-stock portfolios, each made up of issues found
on first line of 1968, Stock Guide. The data used would be readily found
in the Standard &amp; Poor’s Stock guide. The separate criteria applied
were the following, as applied to otherwise random choices: (1) A low
multiplier of recent earnings (not confined to DJIA issues). (2) A high
dividend return. (3) A very long dividend record. (4) Only three of the
groups studied showed up better than the S &amp; P composite (and hence
better than DJIA), viz. (1) Industrials with the highest quality ranking
(A+) These advanced 9½% in the period against a decline of 2.4% for the
S&amp;P industrials, and 5.6% for DJIA. (2) Companies with more than 50
million shares outstanding showed no change on the whole, as against a
small decline In 1971, some 50 or more issues appeared to be obtainable
at or below net-current-asset value. Many of these had been doing badly
in the difficult year 1970. Five issues sold at less than their
working-capital value* at their low prices of 1970. Wall Street takes
this madness in its stride. Diversified apparel company gave 1 1/3
shares of its own stock in exchange for one share of Kayser-Roth.
National Biscuit Co. offered to buy control of Aurora Plastics Co. at
$11 in cash. Universal-Marion Co. asked its shareholders to ratify
dissolution of the concern. For most investors, selecting individual
stocks is unnecessary—if not inadvisable. A small percentage of
investors can excel at picking their own stocks. Get yourself an index
fund and stop wasting your time on stock picking. To see how much a
company is truly earning on the capital it has invested, look to EPS or
return on invested capital. IC = Owner Earnings Invested Capital. ROIC
has the virtue of showing what the company earns from its operating
businesses. An ROIC of at least 10% is attractive; even 6% or 7% can be
tempting. Longleaf’s Mason Hawkins looks for corporate managers who are
“good partners” Warren Buffett has become the world’s most successful
investor by putting new twists on Graham’s ideas. Buffett likes to snap
up a stock when a scandal, big loss, or other bad news passes over it.
He looks for what he calls “franchise” companies with strong consumer
brands, easily understandable businesses, robust financial health.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-16">Chapter 16</h2>
<p>Convertible bonds and preferred stocks have been taking on a
predominant importance in recent years in the field of senior financing.
More than half the preferred issues now quoted in the Standard &amp;
Poor’s Stock Guide have conversion privileges. In 1970, for the first
time in its history, the New York Stock Exchange listed an issue of
long-term warrants. Convertible preferreds carry smaller risk of
eventual loss of principal than common stock. But in most cases the
common would not have been an intelligent purchase to begin with. Even
when a profit appears it brings a dilemma with it. The soundness of
investment in convertible issues can only be tested by their performance
in a declining stock market. Some original purchasers converted their
bonds into the stock and held the stock through its great decline. In
March 1948 the stock sold as low as 7 3/8. This represented a value of
only 27 for the debenture issues. The interest return on the bonds has
generally been less than half the corresponding dividend yield on the
stock. The fast-expanding “conglomerates’ have been the chief
practitioners of convertible legerdemain. In Table 16-3 we list seven
companies with large amounts of stock issuable on conversions or against
warrants. Owners of the common have nothing to lose and important
advantages to gain by switching from their junior shares into the senior
issue. Warrants are created because people are inexpert in financial
matters. They don’t realize that the common stock is worth less with
warrants outstanding than otherwise. The package of stock and warrants
usually commands a better price in the market than would the stock
alone. In the usual company reports the per-share earnings are (or have
been) computed without proper allowance for the effect of outstanding
warrants. From 1998 through 2002, convertibles generated an average
annual return of 4.8%. In 2002, the Merrill Lynch All U.S. Convertible
Index lost 8.6%—versus the 22.1% loss of the S &amp; P 500-stock index
and the 31.3% decline in the NASDAQ Composite stock index. Warrants were
an extremely widespread technique of corporate finance in the nineteenth
century. From 1957 through 2002, convertible bonds earned an annual
average return of 8.3% — only two percentage points below the total
return on stocks. Most converts are now medium-term, in the
seven-to-10-year range; roughly half are investment-grade. Many issues
now carry some call protection (an assurance against early redemption)
As the bear market clawed its way through 2003, it dug up an old fad:
writing covered call options. What are covered calls, and how do they
work? Imagine that you buy 100 shares of Ixnay Corp. at $95 apiece. You
then sell (or “write”) a call option on your shares.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-17">Chapter 17</h2>
<p>Four Extremely Instructive Case Histories on Wall Street. Four
companies to be reviewed, and the different extremes that they
illustrate. The Penn Central Case. Its bankruptcy in 1970 shocked the
financial world. It has defaulted on most of its bond issues, and has
been in danger of abandoning its operations entirely. “earnings” of
$6.80 a share—in reflection of which the common stock later rose to its
peak of 86½. This was a valuation of over $2 billion for the equity. How
many of these buyers knew at the time that the so lovely earnings were
before a special charge of $275 million or $12 per share?
Ling-Temco-Vought stock fell from 169½ to 7 1/8 per share in less than
three years. At the end of 1967 the bank loans had reached $161 million,
and a year later they stood at $414 million. The losses in 1969 and 1970
far exceeded the total profits since formation of the company. Sharon
Steel Co. bought 650,000 warrants at a price of $9.38 each. The company
bought in this warrant “paper money” at a time when its 5% bonds were
selling at less than 40 cents on the dollar. In one of the footnotes we
find an entry designated as “fair market value of warrants issued in
connection with acquisition, etc., $22,129,000” A college student named
Williams began selling mobile homes (then called “trailers”) In 1965 he
incorporated his business. By 1968 he had joined the “franchising”
movement and was selling others the right to sell mobile homes under his
business name. He also conceived the bright idea of going into the
business of preparing income-tax returns, using his mobile homes as
offices. The speculative public is incorrigible. In financial terms it
cannot count beyond 3. It will buy anything, at any price, if there
seems to be some “action” in progress. Should not responsible investment
houses refrain from identifying themselves with such enterprises, nine
out of ten of which may be foredoomed to ultimate failure? Lucent bought
optical equipment supplier Chromatis Networks for $4.8 billion. In
fiscal year 2001, Lucent lost $16.2 billion; in fiscal year 2002, it
lost another $11.9 billion. Tyco International Ltd. spent a total of
more than $37 billion from 1997 through 2001. In 1999, after an
accounting review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Tyco
retroactively added $257 million in MORON charges to its 1998 expenses.
Time Warner was a vastly bigger company by any measure except one: the
valuation of its stock. America Online bedazzled investors simply by
being in the Internet industry, its stock sold for a stupendous 164
times its earnings. eToys filed for bankruptcy protection after racking
up net losses of more than $398 million in its brief life as a public
company. The stock, which peaked at $86 per share in October 1999, last
traded for a penny. In the preceding three months, Toys “R” Us had
earned $27 million in net income and had sold over 70 times more goods
than eToy had sold in an entire year.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-18">Chapter 18</h2>
<p>In this chapter we shall attempt a novel form of exposition. By
selecting eight pairs of companies which appear next to each other we
hope to bring home some of the many varieties of character, financial
structure, policies, performance, and vicissitudes of corporate
enterprises. In each comparison we shall comment only on those aspects
that have a special meaning and import. Real Estate Equities had typical
price fluctuations after 1969. The issue may have been somewhat
overpriced at its record high in 1968, but the shareholders have been
honestly and well served by their trustees. The company’s auditors
refused to certify the financial statements for 1969–70. The shares were
suspended from trading on the American Stock Exchange. Pair 4: H &amp; R
Block, Inc. (Income-Tax Service) and Blue Bell, Inc., (Manufacturers of
Work Clothes, Uniforms, etc.) Pair 3: Home (Home) and Hospital
(Hospital) Pair 4: Blue Bell (Blue Bell) Blue Bell proved a better buy
than Block as of the end of 1969. But the fact that Block was able to
advance some 35% from that apparently inflated value indicates how wary
analysts and investors must be to sell good companies short. How did
these extraordinary disparities develop? The answer lies in the two
magic words: profitability and growth. Flavors made a remarkable showing
in both categories, while Harvester left everything to be desired. Pair
6: McGraw Edison (Public Utility and Equipment; Housewares) McGraw-Hill,
Inc. (Books, Films, Instruction Systems; Magazine and Newspaper
Publishers; Information Services) Pair 7: National General Corp. (A
Large Conglomerate) and National Presto Industries (Diverse Electric
Appliances, Ordnance) National General had a market capitalization of
$534 million, not counting an impending issue of convertible bonds.
Despite National General’s enormously greater capitalization, it had
actually done considerably less gross business than Presto in their
fiscal years. National Presto increased its per-share earnings somewhat
in both 1969 and 1970, marking 10 years of uninterrupted growth. , had
paid continuous dividends since 1936, and was currently returning one of
the highest dividend yields in the entire common-stock list. To indicate
more vividly the disparity in the performance of the two companies we
append, in Table 18-8B, the earnings and price record for 1961–1970.
Cisco Systems, Inc., became the world’s most valuable corporation as its
stock hit $548 billion in total value. Sysco Corp., which supplies food
to institutional kitchens, had been publicly traded for 30 years. The
cheap stocks may later become overpriced; the expensive stocks may turn
cheap. Cisco’s stock lost three-quarters of its value from 2000 through
2002. Sysco, meanwhile, kept giving out profits, and the stock gained
56% over the same period. In a single month, Yahoo! gained roughly $58
billion to reach a total market value of $114 billion. Commerce One had
assets of just $385 million and reported a net loss of $63 million.
Capital One Financial Corp., an issuer of MasterCard and Visa credit
cards, had $12 billion in total assets and earned $363 million in 1999.
For each share of 3Com they held, investors would receive 1.525 shares
of Palm. Palm’s stock was valued at 1,350 times earnings. At $81.81,
traders were saying that all of 3Com’s other businesses combined were
worth a negative $63.16 per share, or a total of minus $22 billion.
Rarely in history has any stock been priced more stupidly. Ball, the
original maker of the famous “Ball Jars’ used for canning fruits and
vegetables, now makes metal and plastic packaging for industrial
customers. Between July 9 and July 23, 2002, as WorldCom keeled over
into bankruptcy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell from 9096.09 to
7702.34. Nortek earned $41.6 million in 2000, $8 million in 2001, and
$55 million in 2002. Its stock went from $28 a share to $45.75 by
year-end 2002. By the end of 2002, Nortel had bled more than $36 billion
in red ink.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-19">Chapter 19</h2>
<p>In the last 36 years practically nothing has actually been
accomplished through intelligent action by the great body of
shareholders. Poor managements are not changed by action of the “public
stockholders,” but only by the assertion of control by an individual or
compact group. The idea that public shareholders could really help
themselves by supporting moves for improving management and management
policies has proved too quixotic. In the last 20 years the “profitable
reinvestment” theory has been gaining ground. The better the past record
of growth, the readier investors and speculators have become to accept a
lowpay-out policy. In many cases of growth favorites the dividend rate
has seemed to have virtually no effect on the market price. perous
companies for the declared purpose of expanding the business. We feel
that such a policy is illogical on its face, and should require both a
complete explanation and a convincing defense before the shareholders
should accept it. In terms of the past record there is no reason a
priori to believe that the owners will benefit from expansion moves
undertaken with their money. The most dangerous untruths are truths
slightly distorted. substituting stock dividends for the present
stock-dividends-plus-subscription-rights combination is enormous. We
urge that this change be made by the public utilities, despite its
adverse effect on the U.S. Treasury. It is completely inequitable to
impose a second (personal) income tax on earnings which are not really
received by the shareholders. In 1999, Enron Corp. ranked seventh on the
Fortune 500 list of America’s top companies. The proxy reported that the
partnerships had already bought $170 million of assets from Enron. Two
clear lessons emerge from this disaster: Never dig so deep into the
numbers that you check your common sense at the door. Managers have
always told shareholders that they know best what to do with the
company’s cash. Graham saw right through this managerial malarkey. Only
3.7% of companies that first sold their stock to the public that year
paid a dividend. Paying out a dividend does not guarantee great results,
but it does improve the typical stock return. Companies get a tax break
when executives and employees exercise stock options. CEOs would much
rather buy back stock than pay dividends. Drowsy investors have given
their companies free rein to over-pay executives. Steve Jobs insisted on
taking $1.1 million a year as a wealthy man. If Apple stock rises by
just 5% annually through the beginning of 2010, he will be able to cash
in his options for $548.3 million. Even if Apple’s stock earns no better
than half the long-term average return of the overall stock market, Jobs
will land a half-a-billion dollar windfall. No CEO ever deserves to make
himself rich if he has produced poor results for you.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-20">Chapter 20</h2>
<p>Margin of Safety is essential to the choice of sound bonds and
preferred stocks. A common stock may be considered sound because it
enjoys a margin of safety as large as that of a good bond. Common stocks
bought under such circumstances will supply an ideal, though infrequent,
combination of safety and profit opportunity. The danger to investors
lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market,
or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more than
average risk of diminished earning power. Over a ten-year period the
typical excess of stock earning power over bond interest may aggregate
50% of the price paid. This figure is sufficient to provide a very real
margin of safety which, under favorable conditions, will prevent or
minimize a loss. The margin of safety is always dependent on the price
paid. It will be large at one price, small at some higher price,
nonexistent at some still higher price. For such favored issues the
market has a tendency to set prices that will not be adequately
protected by a conservative projection of future earnings. Even with a
margin in the investor’s favor, an individual security may work out
badly. To have a true investment there must be present a true margin of
safety. Conventional investments are appropriate for the typical
portfolio. unconventional investments are those that are suitable only
for the enterprising investor. Undervalued common stocks of secondary
companies are recommended for purchase when they can be bought at
two-thirds of their indicated value. Investment is most intelligent when
it is most businesslike, says Fox Mulder. Mulder: Risk has some profound
and profound attributes. The people who take the biggest gains in the
bull market are almost always the worst in the bear market that
inevitably follows, Mulder writes. Daniel Kahneman: Financial risk
resides not in what kinds of investments you have, but in what kind of
investor you are. Kahneman explains two factors that characterize good
decisions: well-calibrated confidence and correctly-anticipated regret.
If you overestimate how well you really understand an investment, or
overstate your ability to ride out a temporary plunge in prices, it
doesn’t matter what you own or how the market does. Before you invest,
you must ensure that you have realistically assessed your probability of
being right and how you will react to the consequences of being wrong.
The probability of making at least one mistake at some point in your
investing lifetime is virtually 100%, and those odds are entirely out of
your control. Many “investors” put essentially all of their money into
dot-com stocks in 1999.</p>
