<h1 id="elon-musk">Elon Musk</h1>
<p>Elon Musk asked me to dinner for a negotiation of sorts. Musk wanted
a measure of control over his life’s story. Musk has his version of the
truth, and it’s not always the truth that the rest of the world shares.
Desperate to keep Musk happy, I handed him a big chunk of steak from my
plate. Elon Musk is the founder and CEO of SpaceX, a company that aims
to turn humans into space colonizers. Musk has been asked by dozens of
journalists to help with a book about his life and work, but he has
never said yes. Musk once asked a reporter, “Do you think I’m insane?”
Elon Musk is a member of Silicon Valley’s techno-utopian club. Musk had
struck me as a well-intentioned dreamer. His once-beleaguered companies
were succeeding at unprecedented things. Musk built an honest-to-God
rocket factory in the middle of Los Angeles. Tesla. acquired several
buildings that used to be part of a Boeing factory, which made the
fuselages for 747s. One of these buildings serves as the research,
development, and design studio for Tesla. This is where the company came
up with the look for the Model S sedan and its follow-on, the Model X
SUV. In 2000, San Francisco had been overtaken by the boom of all booms
and consumed by avarice. Greed and self-interest were the only things
that made any sense back then. The implosion of the get-rich-quick
Internet fantasy left San Francisco and Silicon Valley in a deep
depression. Jonathan Huebner: Silicon Valley’s lull in innovation could
signal a much larger problem. He says the number of patents filed per
person has declined over time. Peter Thiel, the PayPal cofounder and
early Facebook investor, promoted the idea that the technology industry
had let people down. Elon Musk has built two of the most successful
clean-tech companies in the world. Musk is one of the world’s richest
men, with a net worth of around $10 billion. His companies would make
things from scratch and try to rethink much that the aerospace,
automotive and solar industries had accepted as convention. Musk shares
custody of his five young boys with his ex-wife, Justine, and has them
four days a week. Musk tabulates theamount of flight time he endures per
week to help him get a sense of just how out of hand things are. Musk
rarely finds time to decompress, but when he does, the festivities are
just as dramatic. Elon Musk invited fifty people to a castle in
Tarrytown, New York. The party had a Japanese steampunk theme, which is
sort of like a sci-fi lover’s wet dream. The festivities included a
performance of The Mikado, a Victorian comic opera by Gilbert
andSullivan set in Japan. Elon Musk has taken industries like aerospace
and automotive that seemed to have given up on and recast them as
something new and fantastic. At the heart of this transformation are
Musk’s skills as a software maker and his ability to apply them to
machines. Musk could be using his skills to pave the way toward an age
of astonishing machines and science fiction dreams.</p>
